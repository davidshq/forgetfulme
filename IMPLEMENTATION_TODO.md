- All services require unit tests with mocking
- Integration tests required for Chrome API interactions
- E2E tests required for complete user workflows

### Architecture Adherence
- Follow 6-service architecture strictly
- Use dependency injection throughout
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep services focused on single responsibilities

├── services/ (6 focused services) ✓
├── controllers/ (3 UI controllers + BaseController) ✓
├── types/ (JSDoc type definitions) ✓
├── utils/ (4 utility modules) ✓
├── background/ (1 of 3 background services)
├── ui/ (HTML files + styles/) ✓
└── main/ (4 entry point scripts) ✓
```

### Testing Targets Specificity
- **Current Status**: Strong testing foundation with 10 test files (unit: 4, integration: 1, visual: 4, plus setup)
- **Unit Testing**: 3 of 6 services tested (ErrorService, StorageService, ValidationService)
- **Visual Regression**: Comprehensive coverage with baseline screenshots for all UI states
- **Integration Testing**: Basic Playwright setup with popup interactions
- **E2E Workflows**: Framework ready, needs user journey implementation
- **Performance**: Architecture optimized, needs measurement and benchmarking
- **Behavior-Focused**: Implemented approach testing user workflows over implementation details

### Development Workflow Requirements
1. **Always run `npm run check` with every change** (ESLint + Prettier)
2. **Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes**
3. **Test behavior, not implementation details**
4. **Use dependency injection pattern throughout**
5. **Follow CSP guidelines strictly - no external scripts**
6. **Mock only external APIs (Chrome, Supabase) - never internal logic**

This todo provides a complete roadmap for building the ForgetfulMe Chrome extension from scratch, following the established architecture and testing requirements documented in the project.

### 🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS STATUS

**Current Status**: **Advanced Beta** - Extension is architecturally complete with comprehensive visual testing, but unit test failures prevent production deployment.

**Blocking Issues**: 
- 63 failing unit tests (reduced from 82 - significant progress made)
- BookmarkService and remaining StorageService test issues
- No live Supabase backend integration
- Missing controller unit tests

**Estimated Time to Production**: 
- **Fix remaining tests + database setup**: 1-2 weeks (was 1-2 weeks)
- **Production polish + Chrome Web Store**: 1-2 weeks (improved due to progress)
- **Total**: 2-4 weeks (reduced from 3-5 weeks)

**Confidence Level**: **High** - The architecture is excellent, visual testing is comprehensive, and the codebase is production-quality. The main blockers are test debugging and backend setup, both solvable with focused effort.
