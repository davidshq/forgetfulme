## Critical Development Notes

### Security Requirements
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use only Supabase anon key (never service role key)
- Maintain CSP compliance throughout
- Implement Row Level Security on all database tables

### Testing Requirements  
- Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes
- All services require unit tests with mocking
- Integration tests required for Chrome API interactions
- E2E tests required for complete user workflows

### Architecture Adherence
- Follow 6-service architecture strictly
- Use dependency injection throughout
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep services focused on single responsibilities

### Development Workflow
1. **Always run `npm run check` with every change** (ESLint + Prettier)
2. **Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes**
3. **Test behavior, not implementation details**
4. **Use dependency injection pattern throughout**
5. **Follow CSP guidelines strictly - no external scripts**
6. **Mock only external APIs (Chrome, Supabase) - never internal logic**
