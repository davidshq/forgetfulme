- Maintain CSP compliance throughout
- Implement Row Level Security on all database tables

### Testing Requirements  
- Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes
- All services require unit tests with mocking
- Integration tests required for Chrome API interactions
- E2E tests required for complete user workflows

### Architecture Adherence
- Follow 6-service architecture strictly
- Use dependency injection throughout
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep services focused on single responsibilities

---

## Additional Implementation Requirements

### Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Specifics
- [ ] Service worker architecture instead of background pages
- [ ] Proper message passing between contexts (popup, options, background)
- [ ] CSP compliant with no external script loading
- [ ] Declarative keyboard shortcut registration
- [ ] Commands API for Ctrl+Shift+R shortcut
- [ ] Tabs API for current page information
- [ ] Storage API for cross-device sync
- [ ] Notifications API for user feedback
- [ ] Action API for badge and icon state

### Development Philosophy Requirements
- [ ] No comments unless explicitly requested
- [ ] Thoughtful but not over-engineered architecture
- [ ] Static HTML first approach
- [ ] Selective JavaScript for dynamic content only
- [ ] Semantic and accessible code as table stakes
- [ ] Use Result<T, E> wrapper for operations that can fail

### Visual Testing Integration (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Run visual tests BEFORE making UI changes
- [ ] Review screenshot diffs carefully before approving changes
- [ ] Update baselines intentionally only when changes are correct
- [ ] Check HTML test report for before/after visual comparisons
- [ ] Screenshot testing for loading, error, success states
- [ ] Before/after visual comparisons in test reports

### File Structure Validation
```
src/
├── services/ (6 focused services) ✓
├── controllers/ (3 UI controllers + BaseController) ✓
├── types/ (JSDoc type definitions) ✓
├── utils/ (4 utility modules) ✓
├── background/ (1 of 3 background services)
├── ui/ (HTML files + styles/) ✓
└── main/ (4 entry point scripts) ✓
```

### Testing Targets Specificity
- **Current Status**: Excellent testing foundation with comprehensive coverage across all layers
- **Unit Testing**: ALL 6 services thoroughly tested (ErrorService, StorageService, ValidationService, ConfigService, AuthService, BookmarkService)
- **Visual Regression**: Comprehensive coverage with baseline screenshots for all UI states
- **Integration Testing**: Basic Playwright setup with popup interactions
- **E2E Workflows**: Framework ready, needs user journey implementation
- **Performance**: Architecture optimized, needs measurement and benchmarking
- **Behavior-Focused**: Implemented approach testing user workflows over implementation details

### Development Workflow Requirements
1. **Always run `npm run check` with every change** (ESLint + Prettier)
2. **Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes**
3. **Test behavior, not implementation details**
4. **Use dependency injection pattern throughout**
5. **Follow CSP guidelines strictly - no external scripts**
6. **Mock only external APIs (Chrome, Supabase) - never internal logic**

This todo provides a complete roadmap for building the ForgetfulMe Chrome extension from scratch, following the established architecture and testing requirements documented in the project.
