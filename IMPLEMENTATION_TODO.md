## üéØ **CURRENT FOCUS: End-to-End Testing & Validation**

**What we were working on before the detour:**
We had just set up the Supabase backend with `schema-simple.sql` and were ready to test the live integration. The plan was to:

1. **Run the connection test script** to validate backend connectivity
2. **Test user authentication** via the extension popup 
3. **Test bookmark CRUD operations** with live data
4. **Verify Row Level Security** is working properly
5. **Test cross-device sync** functionality

**The detour we just completed:**
- Fixed Chrome extension service worker registration errors
- Resolved Supabase library loading issues in browser context
- Implemented secure multi-tier configuration system
- Fixed validation and error handling for authentication
- Added defensive programming for status types loading

**Next immediate steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Extension is now fully functional - you can create test accounts
2. üîÑ Run `node test-supabase-connection.js` to validate the backend
3. üîÑ Test user signup/signin via extension popup
4. üîÑ Test bookmark creation and management
5. üîÑ Verify data persistence and sync

- Maintain CSP compliance throughout
- Implement Row Level Security on all database tables

### Testing Requirements  
- Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes
- All services require unit tests with mocking
- Integration tests required for Chrome API interactions
- E2E tests required for complete user workflows

### Architecture Adherence
- Follow 6-service architecture strictly
- Use dependency injection throughout
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep services focused on single responsibilities

- **Visual Regression**: Comprehensive coverage with baseline screenshots for all UI states
- **Integration Testing**: Basic Playwright setup with popup interactions
- **E2E Workflows**: Framework ready, needs user journey implementation
- **Performance**: Architecture optimized, needs measurement and benchmarking
- **Behavior-Focused**: Implemented approach testing user workflows over implementation details

### Development Workflow Requirements
1. **Always run `npm run check` with every change** (ESLint + Prettier)
2. **Visual regression tests must pass before UI changes**
3. **Test behavior, not implementation details**
4. **Use dependency injection pattern throughout**
5. **Follow CSP guidelines strictly - no external scripts**
6. **Mock only external APIs (Chrome, Supabase) - never internal logic**

This todo provides a complete roadmap for building the ForgetfulMe Chrome extension from scratch, following the established architecture and testing requirements documented in the project.
