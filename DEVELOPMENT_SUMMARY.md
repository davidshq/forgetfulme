test('should handle user workflow', async () => {
  // Mock only external APIs
  global.chrome = createMinimalChromeMock();
  
  // Test actual implementation
  const Component = await import('../component.js');
  const result = await component.handleUserAction();
  
  // Verify real user-facing behavior
  expect(result.userExperience).toBe('expected');
});
```

### Code Quality
- **Complexity**: Keep methods under 10 complexity
