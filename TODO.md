# TODO
- Have keyboard shortcut for quick add.
- Instead of showing the initial add mark as read and waiting until individual has clicked as mark as read, it should check this auto on clicking the icon and open to edit immediately.
- Allow merging of tags.
- Fix DOM mock querySelector/querySelectorAll implementations to properly find elements (see tests/helpers/mocks/dom.js)

# DONE
- Prevent duplicate urls from being saved.
- Change icon color when one has saved something to mark to read.
- Allow deletion and editing of the urls through a UI, it should be separate from the settings page.
- Implement better accessibility.
- Allow searching and filtering through urls.
