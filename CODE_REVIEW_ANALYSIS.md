# Comprehensive Code Review Analysis

**Project:** ForgetfulMe Chrome Extension  
**Analysis Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Scope:** Complete codebase review (excluding existing .md files per requirements)

## 4. Code Quality Issues

### 4.3 Architecture Violations
**MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- **BookmarkService.js:** Depends on 5 services (too many dependencies)
- **StorageService.js:** Mixes Chrome storage with memory cache in single service
- **Controllers:** Handle both UI logic and business logic

## 8. HTML and CSS Analysis

- External CDN dependency for Pico CSS could be compromised

## 10. Recommendations for Improvement

### Architecture

4. **Implement comprehensive error boundaries**

### Security
1. **Content Security Policy hardening**
2. **Input validation at every boundary**
3. **Output encoding for all user content**

### Performance
2. **Implement proper caching strategies**
3. **Memory usage monitoring and cleanup**

### Development Process
1. **Automated code quality checks**
3. **Performance monitoring integration**
4. **Security scanning in CI/CD**
