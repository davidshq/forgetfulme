### 🛠️ **Technical Patterns Established**

1. **DOM Manipulation Helpers**: Created reusable functions for setting up test states
2. **JavaScript Event Handler Mocking**: Established patterns for tab switching, form validation, loading states
3. **Element Visibility Management**: Consistent approach for showing/hiding UI sections
4. **Form Interaction Testing**: Comprehensive form field validation and submission testing

### 📋 **Lessons Learned**

- **DOM Setup Critical**: Tests fail without proper element visibility setup
- **Event Handler Mocking Required**: Complex UI interactions need JavaScript simulation
- **File Protocol Consistency**: All integration tests must use `file://` protocol
- **Incremental Approach Works**: Focus on one test suite at a time for maximum impact

### 🎯 Priority Issues to Fix

**High Priority**:
1. **JavaScript Controller Initialization** - Integration tests need proper controller mocking
2. **Visual Baseline Updates** - Screenshots outdated after UI changes
3. **Timing/Async Issues** - Element visibility timeouts in integration tests
