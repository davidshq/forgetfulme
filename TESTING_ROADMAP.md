```javascript
// Client-side fetch mocking with configurable responses
// Button loading state management
// Form validation and error messaging
// Success/failure flow handling
await setupFormSubmissionHandlers(page, { signup: mockResponse });
```

**Bulk Selection Pattern** (`setupBulkSelection`):
```javascript
// Select-all checkbox functionality
// Individual checkbox state management
// Bulk actions visibility control
// Selected count display updates
await setupBulkSelection(page);
```

**Edit Modal Pattern** (`setupEditModal`):
```javascript
// Modal opening/closing mechanics
// Form validation and error display
// Dynamic element creation for testing
await setupEditModal(page);
```

**DOM Setup Helpers**:
```javascript
// Consistent auth section visibility setup
// Tab switching functionality
// Element state management
await setupAuthSection(page);
await setupTabSwitching(page);
```
