This document provides actionable recommendations for the biggest wins in each category.

## üêõ Biggest Wins for Eliminating Bugs
### **Add Query Result Validation**
**Current Issue**: Limited validation of database query results.
**Impact**: Medium - Potential data integrity issues

**Recommendations**:
- Add query result validation and sanitization
- Implement data type checking for query results
- Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases

## üîÑ Biggest Wins for Removing Duplicate Code

### **Add Storage Error Recovery**
**Current Issue**: Limited error recovery for storage operations.
**Impact**: Low - Minor reliability improvement

**Recommendations**:
- Add retry logic for failed storage operations
- Implement storage operation queuing
- Add storage health monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### **Implement Proper Module System**
**Current Issue**: All classes are global, creating potential naming conflicts.
**Impact**: Medium - Poor encapsulation and potential conflicts

**Recommendations**:
- Use ES6 modules with proper imports/exports
- Implement namespace pattern for extension
- Add module dependency management

### **Add State Management**
**Current Issue**: Application state is scattered across multiple classes.
**Impact**: Medium - Makes debugging and testing difficult

**Recommendations**:
- Implement simple state management pattern
- Add state persistence across contexts
- Create state change listeners

### **Improve Service Layer Architecture**
**Current Issue**: Service classes have mixed responsibilities.
**Impact**: Medium - Reduces testability and maintainability

**Recommendations**:
- Separate data access from business logic
- Implement repository pattern for data operations
- Add service layer interfaces

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### **Add Integration Tests**
**Current Issue**: No end-to-end testing.
**Impact**: Medium - Integration issues may go undetected

**Recommendations**:
- Implement browser extension testing with Puppeteer
- Add automated UI testing
- Create test data fixtures

## üîí Security Improvements

### **Enhance XSS Protection**
**Current Issue**: Some content uses innerHTML without proper escaping.
**Impact**: Medium - Potential XSS vulnerabilities

**Recommendations**:
- Replace remaining innerHTML usage with textContent
- Add HTML escaping for user-generated content
- Implement content security policy

### **Add Authentication Audit Logging**
**Current Issue**: No logging of authentication events.
**Impact**: Medium - Security monitoring concerns

**Recommendations**:
- Add login/logout event logging
- Implement authentication audit trail
- Add session activity monitoring
