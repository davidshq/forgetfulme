# Icons for ForgetfulMe Extension

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Icon Design

The icons should represent the concept of "marking as read" or "bookmarking" with a simple, recognizable design. 

For now, you can use any simple icon or create placeholder icons. The extension will work without these icons, but they're required for the Chrome Web Store and proper extension identification.

## Placeholder Icons

Until proper icons are created, you can:
1. Use a simple bookmark icon
2. Use a checkmark or "read" symbol
3. Create a simple "FM" (ForgetfulMe) logo
4. Use any existing icon set and rename the files appropriately

## Icon Requirements

- PNG format
- Transparent background preferred
- Should be recognizable at small sizes (16x16)
- Consistent design across all sizes
- Should work well in both light and dark browser themes
